"""
Spline is a module which offers various degree splines used for fitting or bootstraping curves via the [`fit`](@ref FinanceModels.fit-Union{Tuple{F}, Tuple{Any, Any}, Tuple{Any, Any, F}} where F<:FinanceModels.Fit.Loss) function.

Available methods:

- `Spline.BSpline(n)` where n is the nth order. A spline function of order n is a piecewise polynomial function of degree n âˆ’ 1. This means that, e.g., cubic polynomial is a fourth degree B-Spline.

This object is not a fitted spline itself, rather it is a placeholder object which will be a spline representing the data only after using within [`fit`](@ref FinanceModels.fit-Union{Tuple{F}, Tuple{Any, Any}, Tuple{Any, Any, F}} where F<:FinanceModels.Fit.Loss).

and convienience methods which create a `Spline.BSpline` object of the appropriate order.

- `Spline.Linear()`
- `Spline.Quadratic()`
- `Spline.Cubic()`

    Spline.Linear()

Create a linear B-spline. This object is not a fitted spline itself, rather it is a placeholder object which will be a spline representing the data only after using within [`fit`](@ref FinanceModels.fit-Union{Tuple{F}, Tuple{Any, Any}, Tuple{Any, Any, F}} where F<:FinanceModels.Fit.Loss).

```julia

BSpline(2)

    Spline.Quadratic()

Create a quadratic B-spline. This object is not a fitted spline itself, rather it is a placeholder object which will be a spline representing the data only after using within [`fit`](@ref FinanceModels.fit-Union{Tuple{F}, Tuple{Any, Any}, Tuple{Any, Any, F}} where F<:FinanceModels.Fit.Loss).
